<h1><center><b>DOM Tree</b></center></h1>

Here is a DOM Tree I created it was built from a simple website example.  I wanted to show the layout of the tree, the elements, and attributes of those elements with the tree structure.  Furthermore it also attempts to show the parent and child relationships by using colours.
